    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What\n",
    "When we deal with robot control problem, we may have multi-tasks. For example, we need end-effector at certain location and if possible in a special orientation or vice versa. Here we said that location goal has higher priority than orientation task, orientation task is so-called secondary tasks. The whole idea come from \"The secondary task movement should not influence prioritized task goal\".\n",

    "Kim [2] Section IV-A is used to show the details of null space technique and how secondary tasks DO NOT influence prior tasks.\n",
