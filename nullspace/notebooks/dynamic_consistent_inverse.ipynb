    "# Dynamically Consistent Pseudo Inverse\n",
    "\n",
    "This document introduces the generalized null space formulation of both kinematics and dynamics. Clearly, they share same underlying mathematical foundation. Moreover, In a redundant system, for inverse of $J$ compliance with operational acceleration constrain, we could deduce the formulation of inverse, $\\bar J$, by involving mass matrix. $\\bar J$ is named dynamically consistent pseudo-inverse.\n",

    "In a redundant system, since there are more controllable joints in configuration space than needed. We could distribute operational space task to configuration space in a smarter way, so-called *task oriented* control by Oussama Khatib. That means we could use different pseudo inverse achieve different optimized goals.\n",
    "In kinematics, pseudo inverse, $J^{-1}$, by SVD minimizes the least square of error.\n",
    "In contrast, dynamic constrain pseudo inverse, $\\bar J$, by bring mass matrix in account to minimizes instantaneous kinetic energy.\n",

    "Later Roy Featherstone showed that this $\\bar J$ is independent of load in Roy (1997).  This might be a torch of future research.\n",
