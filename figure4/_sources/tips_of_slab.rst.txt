Tips of Slab
============


1. Lean in
    Don't let your butt come out
    
2. Use more shoes rubber
    Even you cannot let your feet towards wall, you need more traing for this case, may be more leg power.
    Use feet thumb if there is a small hold on slab

3. Create more space between your feet and wall
    put feet as far as possible from wall

4. Heel down
    but not for small hold on a slab. Again put feet thumb on that small hold
    
5. Pelvis Control
    When pelvis is parallel with wall, we call it **closed**. There are two closed pelvis position:
    
        * case 1 is your both feet is perpendicular with wall. This is stable position
        * case 2 is the heels of feet towards each other. This is stable and ideal for shift weight
    
    
    when pelvis isn't parallel with wall, we call it **open**.
        
        * Since usually putting toe on slab, any heel towards outside will create a **open** sinerio. It is easy for moving the other feet from one hold to another hold.
    
    **Example**: move X first, 
    X could be left feet or right feet, you could use X: left, Y: right OR X:right, Y left 
    
    1. (Optional) **open** the pelvis by moving **heel of Y** toward Y, towards outside, aka let the abad of X open.
    2. **move X** to next foot hold, ideally with inside edge
    3. **close** by rotate **heel of Y** towards X direction, towards inside.
    4. **shift** weight from Y to X
    5. (Optional) **open** by rotate heel of X towards X, outside
    6. **move Y** to next foot hold.
    7. **close** by rotate heel of X towards Y direction, towards inside.
    8. **shift** weight from X to Y
       
    goto step i.
