Tips of Under
=============

1. Don't push your waist to wall.
    In most case, your next move is a small dyno, considering you may not able to hold the under by one hand. To finish this small dyno, launch from a 
    farther limit position not the other limit poisition which is at the end of your movement. You wanna release your waist and then shoot(push wait to
    wall). Not put your waist close to wall at the beginning.
2. Lower your shoulder or maybe elongate your neck
    Lower your shoulder to smooth your force chain
3. Don't try to bend your wrist and elbow to hold a under, use back muscel
    bend your wrist will create imbalance and injury
4. Hold a under by feet. 
    Since the length of your arm is fixed, there is a optimum shoulder position for holding the under by your hand. To adjust shoulder position, adjust
    heel position by moving heel, heel down or heel up. In practice, people tend to heel up and forget to heel down.
5. Hold by thumb. 
    Try your thumb above the under, try it like hold a pitch. By doing this, it give you a chance to push by thumb and smearing by other 4 figures.
