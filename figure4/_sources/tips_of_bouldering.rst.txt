Tips of Bouldering
==================

* **Read routes**

* **Warm-up to help your body prepared, as well as your mental**

* **Brush holds, for your hand, foot and mental**
  
  There isn't any other way to let you oberseve a rock hold more closely than brushing it.
  In statistics, a route just brushed might more possible to let you top. 
  "A brushed route" become a input of conditional reflex of positive result.
  Later, if you brush rocks, you are more confident.

* **Don't throw brush to nowhere**

* **Climb quietly, extremely quietly**

  *Silence* is the hardest climb. :point_up:  
  
* **Climb by legs, not arms**
  
  Your legs are far more strong than your arm.
  Magnus has a wonderful video to show you could climb a V6 route without using elbow joint

* **Watch the foot holds before, at and after the moment putting foot on**

* **Twist to let hip in**

  The farthest reachable point in practical is using your same side hand and feet while you twist.

* **Notice hand gesture/orientation**

  A wrong hand orientation will exhaust your all other body energy pretty fast.

* **Use correct fingers**

  4 palm fingers are more powerful, three(index, middle and ring) are more balance. Balance is power.

* **Try use thumbs, try use thumb itself**

* **If dyno, try shoot from the lowest/farthest position to your target not the closest**

* **Learn how to breath, hold your breath during aggressive movement**
  
  Use valsalva approach if you dyno, that is inhale before shooting, hold your breath during movement.
  Exhale if you cannot reach a far point or anytime you need more flexibility.

* **Re-climb same route, multiple times**

* **During re-climb, climb as fast as possible**
  
* **Chat with others, why not**

* **Actually, don't chat about beta of a route if you or others haven't try it**

* **Try to ignore the level number of routes**
  
  Forget the V-X meaning of all those colorful taps. As people said "*All colors are created equal*"

* **Most important: Don't hurt yourself**

* **Last but not least, Bouldering is in the Olympic Games. It's a GAME!**
